# Polytope-Curvature
Hello! Here we store code and generated data from our Summer 2024 (and ongoing) project.
We are striving to develop a database of combinatorial polytopes.
At the moment, we are focusing on developing our database of simple 3-polytopes.
We hope to move on to a more diverse database of 3-polytopes soon, and eventually catalog higher-dimensional polytopes.
